  <h2>1993</h2>
  <p>The Toronto Raptors were established in the NBA’s effort to expand into Canada. The team’s name and colors were decided through a nation-wide contest, and have remained until this day. During the team’s initial years in the NBA, they struggled and had mostly losing records. There were also several changes in management and coaching staff during that time.</p>

  <h2>1999</h2>
  <p>The team’s performance began to improve due to the acquisition of Vince Carter (left) and Tracy McGrady (right). The team made the playoffs for the first time, however they were eliminated in the first round. This also marked a period where interest in the team would significantly increase in Toronto.</p>

  <h2>2003</h2>
  <p>The team suffered another period of struggle from 2003-2006. Their star player Vince Carter suffered a knee injury for most of the season and some of their recently acquired players had qualms about playing in Toronto which negatively affected the team dynamic. Ratings again began to fall for the team.</p>

  <h2>2006</h2>
  <p>In 2006, the Raptors drafted Power Forward, Chris Bosh, who was a prolific franchise player that was named to the All-Star team several times. Bosh was the focal point of the team until 2010 when he was traded.</p>

  <h2>2010</h2>
  <p>The Raptors began rebuilding. They acquired Kyle Lowry (left) and Demar DeRozan (right) who became the team's next dynamic duo. Although the team experienced success, they were unable to make any significant playoff runs in the Lowry/DeRozan era.</p>

  <h2>2019</h2>
  <p>Before the 2018-2019 season, the Raptors made the controversial trade of Demar DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard. Leonard ended up being the missing link for the team, leading them to their most successful season ever and capping it off with the team's first ever championship.</p>
