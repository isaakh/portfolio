		<p>The city of Toronto is known for rallying behind its sports teams, and the Raptors are no exception. The team consistently breaks fan attendance records in the NBA, with fans so passionate that they watch games outside the stadium in Maple Leaf Square (aka, "Jurassic Park"). The team even has a partnership with Hip-Hop/R&B superstar, Drake, who has driven more attention to the team and influenced jersey designs.</p><br>
